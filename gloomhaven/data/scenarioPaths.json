I'm pretty sure it will end well.\"\nHail explains that she wants to try to bring forth raw power from another plane and contain it in a small orb that could give enhanced powers to anyone possessing it. The containment process, however, requires a lot of gold metal.\n\"Now that you have helped me in my endeavors, I suppose I should return the favor,\" Hail sighs. \"So what was it exactly that you wanted?\" (7) (19) (31) (43)"

It needs your help to get out.You express curiosity about who imprisoned it and why, but the Voice falls silent at the thought.\nAnd that silence is troubling, deep in the dark.You are hopelessly lost, until the Voice returns and continues to direct you, with no answers to your questions. The Voice flashes images of the monsters placed to guard it.And it gives you a plan: if you can connect all the rooms in its chamber, its voice will be able to resonate and take form once again, giving it the ability to banish its captors.\nThe Voice tells you you are near.It tells you to prepare yourself",

There is a powerful cry and all the remaining monsters are destroyed— disintegrated and scattered among the storm.\n\"Thank you, my friends.It is good to finally be rid of those pests.\" The Voice rattles your bones as it speaks. \"And now that that is done, I ask you to aid me again.I am still a prisoner here, trapped in the wind.In order to take a more corporeal form and leave this land, I require my vessels of power returned to me.\"You fall to your knees as the sound subsides, your head ringing from the vibration.The Voice just destroyed your adversaries as if they were nothing.You cannot imagine what it would be capable of if you were to give it more power.\n\"Do not worry, I have no desire to bring calamity to your land.I only wish to be on my way, to be free and unencumbered by this plane.I give you now a vision of where you can find the first vessel.They thought to hide it from me, but I can see it as if it were right in these chambers. Please, bring it to me.\"\nIn a show of goodwill, the Voice directs you back to the entrance of the cave.Far away from its influence, you have a decision to make.You can do its bidding, (32) or you can try to get to the bottom of what exactly the Voice is instead of just meddling with powers you do not understand.(30)",

It is a nice change from the torrent of biting pain that came before. The air is thin, but you are above the clouds now and so the weather is relatively peaceful. It makes it very easy to see the giant, winged lizard perched atop a jagged boulder.\n\"Welcome to my mountain, intrepid adventurers.\" A gravelly voice booms forth from the creature, surprising you with its eloquence.\n\"I hate to back you into a corner, but now that you have come to me, face-to-face, your options are unfortunately limited. I am not particularly hungry at the moment, so I could be convinced to let you live, if you agree to help me in a small matter.\n\"A group of Savvas subdued me in my sleep and removed one of my flame glands, presumably to study.

(33)\n\"Or, if you wish to be cliché,\" the creature says with a sigh, \"you could simply attack me. Slay the dragon, save the princess, and all that.\"\n\"Except I have no princess, and I’m not a dragon—just a drake who has lived a long time and does not wish to end his life today.

And with so much less danger this time, as well.”\nYou look at the Aesther questioningly. “Sure, cultists and demons aren’t exactly friendly encounters, but last time I traveled these lands...well, that is something I swore I would never speak of.”\nHail grows silent until you arrive at the crypt. Opening the ancient doors, you half expect the place to be teeming with cultists and demons once again, but the stone halls are as silent and barren as death. You move towards the main chamber where you find the giant rift, hovering above a demonic altar.\n“Well, you certainly weren’t kidding,” Hail says. “This thing is a beauty! The girth and stability—quite impressive!” Hail walks around the perimeter of the altar, throwing sand in the air and watching it fall.\n“I’m pretty sure I can close it, thanks to old Stonebreaker’s censer here. I can’t imagine the forces on the other side of this rift are going to be all too happy about it, though.”\nHail raises the censer above her head with one arm and plunges the other elbow-deep into the rift. “Gather round, ladies and gentlemen! This is going to be one killer party.”",

Instead, you see her pulling her hand back out of the rift. Her forearm is withered and smoking.\nAs her gnarled fingers clear the chaotic energies of the rift, it wavers and begins to shrink. A great wind picks up in the chamber and the demons fighting with you show fear for the first time. Instead of digging their claws into you, they grab at the stone floor, desperate to stop the pull of the rift.\nTheir efforts are futile, however. Every last one is sucked back into their own plane. The tear shrinks to one brilliant point and disappears.\nHail collapses, and you run to her side. “Oh, don’t mind me,” she coughs. “I’ll be fine. This old body has seen far worse.”\nShe breaks into a fit of coughing, that soon turns into laughter. “That really was something, though, wasn’t it? If there’s one thing I can depend on you for, it’s a challenge.\n“Here, help me up. I need to get back to Gloomhaven immediately. I have many new thoughts for my research. Feel free to come by any time and I’ll figure out some way to properly thank you.”",

He points at a black, flaming rift in space.\n“This,” he says, failing to mask his giddiness. “Is our master: the Gloom. It wanted to thank you personally for murdering so many of our brothers and setting back our plans.”\nOut of the rift, a group of horrendous, bloated corpses appears and shambles toward you.\n“You are worthless fodder!” The figure suddenly screams in exhilaration. “Did you think you could come back into our graces so easily?
