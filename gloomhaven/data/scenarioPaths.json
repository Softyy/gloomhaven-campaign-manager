    "introduction": "The hill is easy enough to find-a short journey past the New Market Gate and you see it jutting out on the edge of the Corpsewood, looking like a rat under a rug. Moving closer you the mound is formed from a black earth. Its small, overgrown entrance presents a worn set of stone stairs leading down into the darkness.\nAs you descend, you gratefully notice light emanating from below. Unfortunately, the light is accompanied by the unmistakable stench of death.You contemplate what kind of thieves would make their camp in such a horrid place as you reach the bottom of the steps. Here you find your answer - a rough group of cutthroats who don't seem to have taken very kindly to your sudden appearance. One in the back matches the description of your quarry.\n\"Take care of these unfortunates,\" he says, backing out of the room.You can vaguely make out his silhouette as he retreats down a hallway and through a door to his left.\n\"Well, it's not every day we get people stupid enough to hand-deliver their valuables to us,\" grins one of the larger bandits, unsheathing a rusty blade.\"We'll be killing you now.\"\nJoke's on them. If you had any valuables, you probably wouldn't be down here in the first place.",

    "introduction": "The stench of death and rotting flesh gets thicker as you kick past the corpses of your foes and head deeper into the underground burial site.

    "conclusion": "Sifting through the carnage left by the battle, you find a cache at the back of the room containing the scrolls you were hired to collect. You can't help but rifle through them a bit, but find that the writing upon them is in some unknown archaic language. One thing that does jump out at you, however, is a map of the northern countryside. A bend in the Still River is clearly marked as a point of interest. Contemplating whether you want to find out more about this so-called \"Gloom,\" you decide that the spot could be a point of interest for you, as well. (4)\nBut that can be forgotten for the moment. You pack up the papers and head back to Gloomhaven to collect your reward.\nMeeting Jekserah once again at the Sleeping Lion, you hand over the papers and are paid the agreed-upon amount.\n\"You know,\" she whispers to you softly under the bustle of the tavern. \"If you're interested, I may have another job for you. A tribe of Inox in the Dagger Forest has ransacked a couple of my caravans headed to the Capital.\"\n\"I told the militia, but they do nothing,\" she spits. \"I can point you in the direction of their encampment. If you can make an example of them, I will pay you even more.\"\nShe places a crude map of the forest on the table and stands up, her jewelry clinking with the movement. \"Come find me when it is done.\" (3)"

All that's left is to head in and make that requested example.",
    "conclusion": "Running through the forest, fleeing the smell of burning flesh, you now find more than enough opportunity to contemplate your actions.\nHow your actions sit with you must be visible on your face as you meet once more with Jekserah, this time in her manor.

And that is all I will say of the matter.I have one more task I would like you to perform.I require a diamond of considerable size for a customer, but I cannot find one anywhere in the city.\"\n\"There is a diamond mine, however, in the southern mountains long since lost to the wilderness. I've heard reports that it is now overrun with Vermlings, no doubt with some other more intelligent force behind them.If you can fight your way in and grab the biggest diamond you can find, I will give you a considerable reward.(9)\"\n\"Now leave me in peace.\"Jekserah's two massive Inox bodyguards step forward, directing you to leave the manor.\nOutside, contemplating your new task, you hear a small voice behind you.\"She's not looking for profit, you know.‚Äù\nYou turn around to see a female Quatryl step out of the alley beside Jekserah's house.She's clad in dark leather armor and holds a conspicuous contraption full of whirring gears and topped with a conical metal piece connected to a tube.\n\"Argeise, city guard, \"she says, introducing herself.\"I know, I don't exactly look the part, but if anyone isn't what they appear to be, it's that Valrath you've been talking to. Sure, she's a merchant, but she's up to something far more sinister.\"\n\"She's been trying to overthrow the military in Gloomhaven for as long as I've been here, and we're all very curious about what her current machinations are.\"\n\"Look, you can go do her bidding like a good little puppy if you want, but if you'd rather actually help this town keep the peace and not get overrun by the wilds, I have a different idea. We'll get to the bottom of Jekserah's plans and expose her for who she really is.\"(8)"

Not all the writing is intelligible, but you get the sense that this crypt is a place of power once used by an ancient civilization. The ancients tapped the power of the elements to enhance their own lives, and while their exact fate is beyond your knowledge, it clearly didn't end well.\nAmong the scripts you also find notes on a couple of other places of power in the area.One appears to see heavy use with the cult and the other is marked as being overrun by vicious undead.It looks as though you have opportunities to either disrupt more of their work(5) or get in their good graces by helping to clear out a threat.(6)"

Behind them an inky darkness spills forth from the hole and coalesces into nightmarish forms full of teeth and claws.You know you must send these terrors of the elemental plane back into the void, but you are paralyzed with fear.",
    "conclusion": "With the cultists and their minions dead, it seems the dark rift is now dormant. It is no less disconcerting, however. You toss a rock at it, and the rock disappears into nothingness. You must admit that you wonder whether you could enter the rift yourself and whether you could survive the trip to wherever that rock ended up. (10)\nAlternately, finding some way to close the rift is probably the more prudent decision.There is an Aesther enchanter in Gloomhaven who may know more about this inter - planar stuff.She's been known to ask for impossible favors before she helps anyone, though.(14)(19)",
