I'm pretty sure it will end well.\"\nHail explains that she wants to try to bring forth raw power from another plane and contain it in a small orb that could give enhanced powers to anyone possessing it. The containment process, however, requires a lot of gold metal.\n\"Now that you have helped me in my endeavors, I suppose I should return the favor,\" Hail sighs. \"So what was it exactly that you wanted?\" (7) (19) (31) (43)"

And with so much less danger this time, as well.”\nYou look at the Aesther questioningly. “Sure, cultists and demons aren’t exactly friendly encounters, but last time I traveled these lands...well, that is something I swore I would never speak of.”\nHail grows silent until you arrive at the crypt. Opening the ancient doors, you half expect the place to be teeming with cultists and demons once again, but the stone halls are as silent and barren as death. You move towards the main chamber where you find the giant rift, hovering above a demonic altar.\n“Well, you certainly weren’t kidding,” Hail says. “This thing is a beauty! The girth and stability—quite impressive!” Hail walks around the perimeter of the altar, throwing sand in the air and watching it fall.\n“I’m pretty sure I can close it, thanks to old Stonebreaker’s censer here. I can’t imagine the forces on the other side of this rift are going to be all too happy about it, though.”\nHail raises the censer above her head with one arm and plunges the other elbow-deep into the rift. “Gather round, ladies and gentlemen!

Instead of digging their claws into you, they grab at the stone floor, desperate to stop the pull of the rift.\nTheir efforts are futile, however. Every last one is sucked back into their own plane. The tear shrinks to one brilliant point and disappears.\nHail collapses, and you run to her side. “Oh, don’t mind me,” she coughs. “I’ll be fine. This old body has seen far worse.”\nShe breaks into a fit of coughing, that soon turns into laughter. “That really was something, though, wasn’t it? If there’s one thing I can depend on you for, it’s a challenge.\n“Here, help me up. I need to get back to Gloomhaven immediately. I have many new thoughts for my research.

I’ll start with rituals that could separate a voice from its host...” The Quatryl sort of drifts off in the middle of his sentence and wanders over to some bookshelves, where he leafs through various texts.\nYou decide to head to the market for a few hours. When you return, the Quatryl rushes up with excitement.\n“I’ve found it!” He waves a book in your face. “I hit a number of dead ends until I realized the voice wasn’t separated, it was just the only thing that can get through the barrier created to imprison it, which implies that the barrier itself was extra-planar, most likely created by the Aesthers ages ago.\n“So I did some digging through all the texts we have on Aesther rituals—which isn’t much, they’re very reticent about such things—but luckily I found this book. It is a specific recounting of the binding of a demon in the Copperneck region you referred to. Apparently the creature was so strong, the Aesthers enlisted the help of the Savvas and the Harrowers, too. They claim it was powerful enough to lay waste to the entire continent.\n“If it’s asking you to help free it, I’d strongly recommend against it. The accuracy of the text is admittedly a little questionable, but whatever this voice is, it was bound for a reason.”\nThe Quatryl finally stops waving the book around and begins to flip through the pages. “In fact, if you can hear the voice from outside the cave, and it has such a strong influence over you, it sounds as if the barrier is weakening, as the author warns.\n“Apparently there is a scepter that could be used to strengthen the binding ritual, but the author says it has been placed on an island along the south shore for safekeeping. There’s a simple incantation detailed in the text to open the door to the shrine.”\nTwo days later, you stand before the ruined structure, which now sits half-sunk in the water-logged earth.

If you free me, I guarantee no harm will come to you. But I cannot say the same if you approach with the scepter. Whatever you think you are doing, you are wrong.”\nAs quickly as it came, the pain stops.

Amazing how some things get forgotten so easily.”\nShe reaches out to touch it, but quickly recoils her hand. “Oh, so this is why you brought it to me? And here I thought it was a token of friendship.” She frowns.\n“That,” she says, pointing at the artifact, “is a clear case of bad gifting. You’re going to have to clean this thing out before I can accept it.\n“The artifact has been attuned to the Plane of Night, capable only of corrupting and destroying everything it comes in contact with.

You’ll need to break the connection to balance it out.”\nYou stare at Hail blankly. “Oh, what, do I have to do everything?” she asks incredulously. “Okay, look, I’m not going to go in there and fix it, but I suppose I can transport your essences through to the other side so that you can sever the shadow link yourselves.”\nHail begins to move her hands fluidly back and forth. Occasionally a hand disappears down to her wrist, only to re-emerge, clutching colorful magics, which she begins to scatter over you.\n“So it’s all very simple. Soon you will find yourselves in the Plane of Night. Just look around for a giant black pillar extending infinitely into the sky, and then destroy it. Once you do that, I’ll bring you back here.”\nBefore you even have time to object, your vision goes dark.

You’re quite lucky I was able to pull you out of there before the whole place collapsed in on itself.\n“The attunement has certainly been severed, though. The artifact is perfectly balanced.” Hail picks up the vessel with her hands and studies it closely. “A true marvel.”\n“All fun aside, though, if you’re looking for the entity who could have attuned it in such a way, I may have something for you there.” She sets down the vessel and pulls a map out of the air, laying it on a rickety table. “After the connection to the Plane of Night was severed, I briefly felt a tug on the artifact from three different locations. It was being used as a power source, but with the source depleted, the tugging stopped almost immediately.\n“I was still able to pinpoint the locations,” Hail states triumphantly, marking the map. “Here, out in the Misty Sea, deep under the surface.

(38) And finally one high atop the peaks of the Coppernecks.” (39)\nHail straightens up and reaches for the artifact. “I’ll keep this safe here.”\nYou look at her disapprovingly. “Okay, fine,” she says. “You can hold on to it.

You’ll need to get what you came for and get out before you are overwhelmed by reinforcements.”\nYou reach a simple wooden door at the end of the tunnel. Carefully trying the door, it doesn’t budge.

These mercenaries, however, were fortunate enough to find someone who would actually give it to them instead of making empty promises.\n“I will stay true to my word. Only those who opposed me will die. The rest are free to continue to live and toil in this place under my rule. I will return to my realm and plan my next move.”\nOver the next few weeks, the city settles back into its routine. Very little changes, except that demons become an everyday sight in the city and taxes are now given to these overlords instead of the human overlords Gloomhaven had previously.\nOne day, you wake to find a deformed demon standing over you, holding a parchment that looks like some sort of skin. “I find myself desiring your help once again, mortals,” it reads. “It appears that many opposition forces in Gloomhaven escaped my grasp and are now camping out in the southern foothills, plotting to take back the city. Such machinations are surely fruitless, but still it is better to crush them now than to wait to see what they do.” (45)",

Now he wishes to destroy Gloomhaven, and you must find a way to stop him.\nAs quickly as you can, you turn and run, pulling a crude bomb out of your pack and throwing it at the pursuing demons. You hear a bellowing roar and then a crash as the explosion collapses the hallway behind you. Perhaps you may have enough time to return to the city and warn them.\nYou scramble up the cliffs of the elemental plane and jump through the rift. You race southward, hardly stopping to catch your breath. Eventually, thankfully, the Old River Gate on the north side of the city looms on the horizon. You approach with haste and summon the Captain of the Guard.\n“This is most troubling,” he says after you explain the situation. “You may have doomed this city with your actions, but you may yet be able to save it.”\n“A force approaches!” You look up at an archer making panicked gestures to the north.
