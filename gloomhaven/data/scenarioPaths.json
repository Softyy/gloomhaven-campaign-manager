    "introduction": "The hill is easy enough to find-a short journey past the New Market Gate and you see it jutting out on the edge of the Corpsewood, looking like a rat under a rug. Moving closer you the mound is formed from a black earth. Its small, overgrown entrance presents a worn set of stone stairs leading down into the darkness.\nAs you descend, you gratefully notice light emanating from below. Unfortunately, the light is accompanied by the unmistakable stench of death.You contemplate what kind of thieves would make their camp in such a horrid place as you reach the bottom of the steps. Here you find your answer - a rough group of cutthroats who don't seem to have taken very kindly to your sudden appearance. One in the back matches the description of your quarry.\n\"Take care of these unfortunates,\" he says, backing out of the room.You can vaguely make out his silhouette as he retreats down a hallway and through a door to his left.\n\"Well, it's not every day we get people stupid enough to hand-deliver their valuables to us,\" grins one of the larger bandits, unsheathing a rusty blade.\"We'll be killing you now.\"\nJoke's on them. If you had any valuables, you probably wouldn't be down here in the first place.",

    "conclusion": "With the last bandit dead, you take a moment to catch your breath and steel yourself against the visions of living remains ripping at your flesh. Your target is not among the dead, and you shudder to think what horrors still await you in the catacombs below. (2)"

    "introduction": "The stench of death and rotting flesh gets thicker as you kick past the corpses of your foes and head deeper into the underground burial site. Guided by the muffled sounds of conversation, you find your way through the maze of crypts and burst into a small room full of hard-faced bandits, all with bows at the ready.\nThey're clearly guarding something. You must be in the right place.",
    "conclusion": "Sifting through the carnage left by the battle, you find a cache at the back of the room containing the scrolls you were hired to collect. You can’t help but rifle through them a bit, but find that the writing upon them is in some unknown archaic language. One thing that does jump out at you, however, is a map of the northern countryside. A bend in the Still River is clearly marked as a point of interest. Contemplating whether you want to find out more about this so-called \"Gloom,\" you decide that the spot could be a point of interest for you, as well. (4)\nBut that can be forgotten for the moment. You pack up the papers and head back to Gloomhaven to collect your reward.\nMeeting Jekserah once again at the Sleeping Lion, you hand over the papers and are paid the agreed-upon amount.\n\"You know,\" she whispers to you softly under the bustle of the tavern. \"If you’re interested, I may have another job for you. A tribe of Inox in the Dagger Forest has ransacked a couple of my caravans headed to the Capital.\"\n\"I told the militia, but they do nothing,\" she spits. \"I can point you in the direction of their encampment. If you can make an example of them, I will pay you even more.\"\nShe places a crude map of the forest on the table and stands up, her jewelry clinking with the movement. \"Come find me when it is done.\" (3)"

It is well-hidden, but following the signs outlined on the parchment, you find a dense cluster of huts in a small clearing of the forest. All that's left is to head in and make that requested example."

Behind them an inky darkness spills forth from the hole and coalesces into nightmarish forms full of teeth and claws.You know you must send these terrors of the elemental plane back into the void, but you are paralyzed with fear."

You glance around the room and see nothing but the usual detritus. Before you can call out to Hail, though, an explosion from an upper room violently shakes the entire building.\n\"Damn it all to the abyss!\" Hail's disembodied voice yells out.\"I set up my work in the most out-of-the-way, uninviting, decrepit little hovel, and grand idiots still manage to stumble in and disrupt my research.\"\n The translucent woman suddenly appears before.\"You do know that your mere presence in this building changes the flow of the ether, causing unanticipated currents that produce catastrophic consequences, right? I mean, how could you not know that ?\"\nHail closes her eyes and begins to take deep breaths, fading a little out of view with each exhale.\"Yes, I did agree to help you.I had hoped the memory was a nightmare of some kind, but it wasn't, so that can't be helped now.The least you can do inreturn, however, is to warn me before you cross the threshold.\"\nShe gives you an icy stare.\"So what do you want, anyway? Let' s make this quick.\" You explain to her the situation with Jekserah and the need to locate where she is hiding.\n\"Ah, a simple scrying matter? Well then, we are in luck, \" Hail begins. \"Or rather, I' m in luck.The main component I would need for such a task is biteroot, and I ran out of it just last week.I was going to gather more, but now I can just send you out to get it instead. Everyone wins!Except those infernal forest imps who terrorize my usual gathering spot. I hope quite a few of them will end up dead.\"\nA small map drops in your hand, and, with a wave of Hail's arms, a sudden, powerful force pushes you out the door.\"Remember: ring the bell when you come back and wait fortyseven seconds before entering the door!\"\nYou are able to follow the map to a network of small caves just north of the Dagger Forest.The place is teeming with life: lush, massive plants, as well as a number of hostile animals and imps.You prepare for their attack."
